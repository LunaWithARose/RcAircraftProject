# RcAircraftProject

## Frame Version 1

* The first attempted version of my frame.
* 2022-23
* Was never capable of flight
* 6ft wingspan, tapered wings, balsa wood rods, 3d printed filament
* 2x 1300kv brushless motors, 2x 11inch carbon fiber propellers, teensy 4.0, nrf24l01 modules, 5200mah battery
* Main problems included: wingspan sag, tail instability, thin wing chords, lack of electronics space, terrible aerodynamics

## Frame Version 2

* Second Updated version of the frame with many fixes
* 2023-24
* First version of the fram to make an attempted flight
* 8ft wingspan, rectangular wing, balsa wood frame, 3d printed filament
* 2x 1300kv brushless motors, 2x 11inch carbon fiber propellers, teensy 4.0, nrf24l01, 5200mah battery
* Used the 1st and 2nd version of the code
* Fixed problems: significantly better electronics space, larger wing chords, much better aerodynamics, better wing-body connection
* Main problems: still significant wing sag, tail isntability, propeller-motor connection was terrible, nrf24l01 connection was sketchy, centery of gravity & mass was questionable

## Frame Version 3

* Third and Fourth Version of my frame
* 2024-45
* Most current addition of the airplane. The version that has flew
* 8ft wingspan, rectangular wing, balsawood + carbon fiber frame, 3d printed filament
* 2x 3200kv brushless motos, 2x 8inch carbon fiber propellers, teensy 4.0, nrf24l01+ln+pa, 6900mah battery
* Used the most recent version of code
* Fixed problems: more areo dynamic body, reduced weight, larger but tapered wing chords, significantly less wing sage, tail stability, got more stable nrf24l01 modules, significantly better center of mass & gracvity. Better propeller-motor connection, perfboard cpu

## Boards

Back in 2020-2022 I was super intrested in making pcb boards. I found pictures of two of them. The DRAC had a teensy 4.0 ARM chip as the telemetry and a Arduino ATmel 2650 as the controls system. Each chip had a backup system. The nrf24l01, TinyGPS, and MPU6050 unit on it. There are plenty of other features that I have lost over the past 5 years. I am putting this here to archive it so I do not forget more.

The current functioning board that runs in the latest version of my airplane is ran by a teensy 4.0.
