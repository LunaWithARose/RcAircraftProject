## Frame Version 1

* The first attempted version of my frame.
* 2022-23
* Was never capable of flight
* 6ft wingspan, tapered wings, balsa wood rods, 3d printed filament
* 2x 1300kv brushless motors, 2x 11inch carbon fiber propellers, teensy 4.0, nrf24l01 modules, 5200mah battery
* Main problems included: wingspan sag, tail instability, thin wing chords, lack of electronics space, terrible aerodynamics

## Frame Version 2

* Second Updated version of the frame with many fixes
* 2023-24
* First version of the fram to make an attempted flight
* 8ft windspan, rectangular wing, balsa wood frame, 3d printed filament
* 2x 1300kv brushless motors, 2x 11inch carbon fiber propellers, teensy 4.0, nrf24l01, 5200mah battery
* Used the 1st and 2nd version of the code
* Fixed problems: significantly better electronics space, larger wing chords, much better aerodynamics, better wing-body connection
* Main problems: still significant wing sag, tail isntability, propeller-motor connection was terrible, nrf24l01 connection was sketchy, centery of gravity & mass was questionable
